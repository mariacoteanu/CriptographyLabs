When I walk in the woods in summer I think of the trees as a shelter.They go to form a protection alike against the sun and passing shower.And if I turn from the old cart-path it is but to enter some one-sidecompartment of a great labyrinth of rooms. No one tree calls forobservation. They are as the inner walls of a great house, and what theysurround alone commands attention. It is going out of doors as much toleave the thick woods as to pass from your dwelling. But now, duringDecember’s bright, cheery, winter days, every tree in these same woodsbecomes my companion. We are exposed to the same sunny sky, and as Iwander from one to another, each has its pleasant greeting for me. Thishas been a life-long fancy of mine. Walk up to a century-old oak, andhow promptly it speaks to you of giant strength and sturdy independence;turn then to a stately liquidambar and you are greeted with exquisitegrace. I can point out in the old woods here at home the counterparts ofmany a man I know. The lonely wild apple on a gravelly knoll is ascrabbed as my crusty neighbor who begrudges me a few flint arrow-heads.I think I should be soured by wandering half a day in a forest ofwild-apple trees. There is no such feeling when with the oaks, beeches,chestnuts, and silver birch. They recall no unfortunates among one’sacquaintance. Every tree of them is content with the world as it findsit, and so too am I when surrounded by them.The woods were quiet when I entered. Not a twig trembled, and the deadleaves were too limp to crackle beneath my feet. Dainty frost crystalswere plentifully strown over the dwarfed bushes by the roadside, and afilm of glittering ice with jagged sides reached out from the banks of alittle brook near by. Nowhere did the ice reach wholly across the stream, and so was the more beautiful by reason of the inky waters thatflowed sluggishly beneath it.Where, about the roots of a massive beech, the brook had become a littlepool, I stood for many minutes, alternately watching the waters thathere seemed roused to a semblance of activity, and then listening to thewelcome cawing of the over-flying crows. Brooks, birds, and trees! Yourchoice of such good company, and yet there are those who would have gonemad here from loneliness! For the time I gave heed to the brook,wondering as usual what might be beneath the surface, and all the while,as ever happens, the creatures of the brook were wondering about myself.If one turns to the text-books he will find much said of the instinctthat leads the lower forms of life to seek a safe shelter as winterapproaches. The lower forms of life in this brook had no such intention.First, I detected dainty little frogs—the peeping hylodes—squatted on dead leaves and yellow pebbles, and so spotted, splotched, and wrinkledwere they that it took sharp eyes to find them. Their idea of a shelter in winter is from enemies, and not from the frosty air; a little warmersunshine to-day would have moved them to sing. Time and again during November they rattled and “peeped” almost as shrilly as ever in April,and they will again, if we are treated to a green Christmas. The spirit of exploration seized me now, and I brushed the shallow waters with a cedar branch. Lazy mud minnows were whipped from their retreats, and a beautiful red salamander that I sent whizzing through the air wriggled among the brown leaves upon the ground. It was only after a hard chase that I captured it, and, holding it in my hand until rested, I endeavored to induce it to squeak, for it is one of a very few that has a voice; but it was not to be coaxed. It suffered many indignities in silence, and so shamed me by its patience that I gently placed it in the brook. Soon, black, shining whirligigs—the gyrinus—suddenly appeared, and a turtle, as if wondering what might be the cause of the commotion, thrust its head in the air, stared angrily at me, and returned to its hidden home. There was no dearth of life in the brook, yet this is a winter day. The ground is frozen, and the rattle of wagons upon the highway penetrates even to this remote recess in the deep woods.As a child soon tires of one toy, so I longed, after an hour’s play, fora new field and other forms of life, and so much for serious study asthat I might vary my amusement; but let not this apparent aimlessness beheld unworthy of the rambler. Call it play, if you choose, but theincidents of such a day come back in bold relief when, with or withoutan effort, they are recalled. I have found it most fortunate that unconscious cerebation is so active when I wander about, toying, as hereby the forest brook, with many forms of life. More than half the acts ofevery creature I meet are apparently meaningless at the moment of theiroccurrence, but their full significance is evident when in thought Iwander a second time over the same ground. Scarcely regarded incidentscome well to the fore and throw a flood of light upon what lacked at thetime any evidence, on the creature’s part, of complicated thought.Herein, I think, lies the secret of so much disappointment when somepeople—and they are many—wander in the fields. Filled with enthusiasticdesire upon laying down the teeming pages of Thoreau and Burroughs, theyexpect to see with another’s eyes and appreciate with another’s brain.They see a bird, a mammal, or a host of butterflies, and then askthemselves upon the spot, Well! what of them? The bare fact of theirpresence is all that the minds of inexperienced ramblers encompass. Thewild life they have met excites a passing thrill and they give nofurther heed to it. And it never occurs to many to recall the incidents.Being a bit disappointed then, why give heed to the subject later? On the contrary, if at the close of the day, in the hills and hollows ofthe blazing wood upon the andirons, if the walk was in winter, we picture the scenes of the recent ramble, these same birds or mammals, or whatsoever else we saw, will be seen again in a new light. Why those birds and not others were where we found them; why the field-mice orrabbits or a weasel were where we saw them or it, will become evident. The various features of every visited spot will be remembered; and thecheery blaze upon the hearth tells us, as it were, the story that could not be read when facing Nature’s open page. Some of us inveterateramblers read more than others, when in the fields, but no one can afford to trust to this alone. To extract the whole truth, the past mustbe recalled again and again.As I whiled away the time with the tenants of the brook, so I gave heedto every passing bird, and what a strange panorama, as one kind afteranother flitted by! The happy association of woods and water here, as itattracted me, drew them to the spot, yet no one loitered long. The busy brown tree-creeper traced the crannies of the wrinkled oaks; the nuthatches followed, and their complaining squeaks seemed expressive of disappointment that so little food was to be found. Was this true? Werethese little birds really complaining? It certainly seemed so. But howtreacherous is this impression of seeming so! Too often, I fear, therambler is content with it and goes his way convinced that what wasvaguely apparent was the truth, the whole truth, and nothing more nor less. I hold it probably true that if every bird which found itself toolate was disposed to complain, there would be a vast deal morequarreling than actually occurs. How little contention there is in thebird-world! While it is true that birds of a feather flock together, itis equally so that widely different species also amicably associate, andflagrant is the act that calls for punishment. Better luck next time isthe homely proverb that actuates all non-predatorial bird life.But the merit of birds is their suggestiveness. Promptly following thenuthatches came the ever-welcome song-sparrow. It hopped, withspringtide liveliness, among the dead leaves near the brook, and then,flying to a hazel bush near by, it sang that sweet song that not eventhe mocking-bird ventures to repeat. The woods vanished, and the oldgarden with its gooseberry hedge was before me. I was a wondering childagain, listening and looking at the happy bird, happy as itself.It is December, the day is cold, the trees are leafless, the groundfrozen; but not a thought of all this had clouded my joy for half a day.There is the elixir of perpetual summer even in the woods in winter, andhappy is he who can find it.
